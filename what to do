Using objects.
    modified our game to
    create characters depending what the user uses suchs as
        class
            stats
                damage
                health
                agility
        weapon
        skill
    create a situation where we fight a creature
    simulate a fight using the stats we defined before with multiple options
    depending of the outcome of the fight, we get a win or lose scenario
